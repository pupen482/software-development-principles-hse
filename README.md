# Software Development Principles HSE

This project contains several programming tasks demonstrating principles of software development, including console applications, GUI (Qt), multithreading, and network communication.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GNU Make

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   make install
   ```

## Tasks and How to Run

### Task 1: Simple Console Calculator
Run:
```sh
make task_1
```

### Task 2: Advanced Calculator (with variables and functions)
Run:
```sh
make task_2
```

### Task 3: Qt Todo List Application
Run:
```sh
make task_3
```

### Task 4: Qt Todo List with JSON File Handling
Run:
```sh
make task_4
```

### Task 6: Multithreaded Garden Simulation
Run:
```sh
make task_6
```
The program will prompt you to enter the number of flowers and gardeners in the terminal.

### Task 7: TCP Server and Client Communication

#### Start the server (in one terminal):
```sh

```

#### Start the client (in another terminal):
```sh
make task_7_client
```

Type messages in the client and server terminals to exchange data over TCP.
